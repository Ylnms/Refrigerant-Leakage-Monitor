# Refrigerant-Leakage-Monitor

• Developed an IoT-based system to detect AC refrigerant leakages using sensors. 

• Aimed to enhance safety for households and industries by preventing hazardous 
incidents.

Components Required:

1.Arduino Uno 
2.Gas Sensor 
3.Buzzer 
4.LCD (16x2) 
5.Power Supply 
6.Connecting Wires 
7.IR LED 
8.IR Reciever       
9.R-600a GAS(Iso butane)

The Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board. It acts as the central processing unit of the Refrigerant Leakage Monitoring System. The Arduino Uno is responsible for reading data from the gas sensor, processing this data, and making decisions based on predefined logic.
